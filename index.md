How much can global land contribute to climate change mitigation under varying land-consuming lifestyles?

Land-based climate solutions, such as afforestation, compete for land with food, biomaterial, and bioenergy production. Thus, the availability of climate change-mitigating land depends heavily on societal decisions and lifestyles.


<h3 style="color: #808080;">The Study</h3>
These pages show results of a study on the global climate mitigation performance of land, conducted by Freistetter et al. (2024, manuscript in preparation). We assessed a total of 864 scenarios combining different scenarios from the scenario domains 
- Costs of Emissions (e.g. global carbon tax)
- Global Diet
- Regional agricultural self-sufficiency
- Biodiversity Policies
- Wood Demand
- Forest Fire Risk
  


<h3 style="color: #808080;">The SuCCESs IA-Model</h3>
In this study, we employed the SuCCESs integrated assessment model (Ekholm T. et al., 2024, manuscript in preparation) - a new, lightweight optimazation model able to assess global climate change mitigation options. It calculates long-term sceanrios (2020-2100) satisfying global demands for climate-relevant products and services, such as transportation, plant and livestock-based foods, fossil and renewable types of energy, bio-based and fossil materials for industry and construction, and more. Its output includes, among many things, the decadal global mean temperature rise (above pre-industrial measures), emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O and the energy mix.
