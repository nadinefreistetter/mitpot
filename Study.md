These pages show results of a study on the global climate mitigation performance of land, conducted by Freistetter et al. (2024, manuscript in preparation).

<h3 style="color: #808080;">800+ Scenarios</h3>
 We assessed a total of 864 scenarios combining different scenarios from the scenario domains 
- Carbon tax
- Global diet
- Regional agricultural self-sufficiency
- Biodiversity policies
- Wood demand
- Forest fire risk

<h3 style="color: #808080;">The SuCCESs IA-Model</h3>
In this study, we used the SuCCESs integrated assessment model, which is a new, lightweight optimization model designed to evaluate global climate change solutions (Ekholm et al., 2024, manuscript in preparation). 

It calculates long-term scenarios from 2020 to 2100, addressing global needs for products and services that impact the climate, such as transportation, plant and livestock-based foods, fossil and renewable energy, and bio-based and fossil materials for industry and construction. 

The model's outputs include the projected global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and the composition of the energy mix.

The model has four main parts: Energy, Materials, Land-Use and Climate. These parts enable a broad analysation of feedback mechanisms of employing one or multiple mitigation strategies at once.
